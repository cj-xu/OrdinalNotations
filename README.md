# Ordinal notations via simultaneous definitions
We define an ordinal notation system simultaneously with its ordering.  Our simultaneous definitions generate only the ordinal terms in Cantor normal form which are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinals below ε₀.  We implement the ordinal notation system as inductive-inductive-recursive definitions in Agda.
